## 👩🏽‍💻 Hello, World 0101! Your First Step into Programming

> *"The journey of code begins with a single `print()`."*

### ✨ Welcome!✨

Whether you're dreaming of building your own app, learning to upskill, designing games, or just curious about how code works, this blog series is your gateway to programming.

We’re starting from the very beginning, and there’s no better way to begin than with the classic **Hello, World!** program. Don't mind the 0101, these represent binary code, which we'll cover in a later lesson.

### What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks. These instructions are written in **programming languages** like Python, JavaScript, or Java.

Your first step as a programmer is learning how to talk to the computer and get it to talk back!

### Why "Hello, World!"?

The phrase **"Hello, World!"** has become the traditional first program when learning a new language. It’s simple, but it teaches you:

* How to write code
* How to run it
* How your computer responds

It’s the " first hello" between you and the world of coding. Ahaha get it? Hello... Hello World? No? Okay. I'll stick to my day job, moving on✨

### 💻 Your First Code

 I first learned to code in Java, but once you master any language it's easier to get a hang of the others. Let’s see how to write "Hello Word" in a few popular languages:

#### Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

#### Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

###  Try It Yourself

 Choose a language above

 Type the code into an online editor like:

* [Jdoodle.com](https://www.jdoodle.com)
* [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/)
* [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

✅ Run it: and watch your first message appear!

---

###  Quick Challenge

1. Change the message to say:

   ```
   Hello, [Your Name]!
   ```
2. Try writing it in another language.
3. Save your code, it’s your first creation!

---

###  Key Takeaways

* Every programming language has its own **syntax** (rules).
* The core idea and giving instructions stays the same.
* You just wrote and ran your first program!

---

###  What’s Next?

In the next lesson, we’ll explore [Understanding Variables](./understanding-variables.md) the building blocks of any program. You’ll learn how to store data and make your programs smarter.

Stay curious, and keep coding! 💡
