##  Understanding Variables

Variables are one of the first concepts you’ll encounter when learning to code. Think of a variable as a **labeled container** for data  it holds a value that your program can use or change.

##  Why Use Variables?

Imagine needing to store your age in a program:

```python
age = 30
````

Or in JavaScript:

```javascript
let age = 30;
```

Now you can refer to `age` anywhere in your code, and it will represent the value `30`.

## Types of Variables

Variables can hold different **data types**, like:

* Text: `"Hello"` (a string)
* Numbers: `42` (an integer)
* True/False: `True` / `False` (boolean)
* Lists or Arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`
* Objects / Dictionaries: `{ "name": "Alice" }`

---

##  Naming Rules

* Must start with a letter or `_`
* Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
* Should be descriptive: `userName` is better than `x`

---

##  Mini Challenge

Try declaring 3 variables:

1. Your name (as a string)
2. Your favorite number
3. Whether you like coding (boolean)

Then print them out!

##  Key Takeaways

* Variables store data
* They make your code reusable and readable
* Mastering variables is the first step to thinking like a programmer
